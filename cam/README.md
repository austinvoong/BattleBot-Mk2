# Computer Vision for Robot Navigation: General Concepts
Computer vision typically contains these key components:
- Image Acquisition: Capturing video frames from a vamera
- Image Processing: Enhancing images for better analysis
- Object Detection: Identifying obstacles, targets, landmarks
- Path Planning: Determining optimal routes based on visual data
- Control Integration: Sending commands to ESP32

Here is a potential file structure of /cam
```
